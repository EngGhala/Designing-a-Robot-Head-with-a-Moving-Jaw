Step-by-Step Guide to Designing a Robot Head with a Moving Jaw
1. Start a New Design:
* Go to Tinkercad and click "Create new design" to begin a new project.
2. Create the Head Shape:
* Choose a "Sphere" or "Cylinder" shape from the basic shapes menu to form the main structure of the robot head.
* Resize the shape as needed to match the desired dimensions of the head.
3. Integrate the Real Screen:
* Search for “Screen” and choose a suitable one.
* Attach the screen to the head  and ensure it is centered and securely placed.
4. Design the Jaw:
* Create the jaw using a "Half Cylinder" shape.
* Place the jaw at the lower part of the head, ensuring it aligns well with the overall design.
* Adjust the jaw's size so that it looks proportional to the head.
5. Insert the Servo Motors:
* Search for "Servo Motor" in the Tinkercad components.
* Place one servo motor on each side of the head, aligning them with the jaw's hinge point.
* Ensure the motors are correctly positioned to allow the jaw to move up and down when activated.
6. Adjust and Align the Components:
* Ensure all components, including the servo motors, jaw, and screen, are properly aligned.
* Adjust the positioning as needed to ensure that the jaw operates smoothly without any obstruction.
7. Save and Finalize the Design:
* Once everything is aligned and functioning as intended, save your work in Tinkercad.
